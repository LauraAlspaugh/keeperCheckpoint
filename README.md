Keepr is a full stack application built out over the course of five days. We use .NET for the server side and Vue for the client side. Built in resemblance to Pinterest, users have teh ability to create 'keeps' and save them to their 'vaults' or boards. We worked with one to many, and many to many relationships. Incorporating all our skills learned over the past 12 weeks, we did our best to time box, and put our knowledge to the test to finish this application.
